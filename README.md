PowerNap:
========
Android application that optimizes your power nap experience by running an Accelerometer application in the background.

--- APPLICATION EXPLAINED---

When you set the alarm and go to sleep, the accelerometer tracks your movement and if your movement is higher than the threshold we set, it will not set the alarm since you
would not be having a power nap and it will keep delaying the alarm until your movement is lower than the treshold. There is a priority feature called 'must wake up by' which
allows you to set a time(if you want to) that you absolutely must wake up and when the clock hits that time, it will never set the alarm so actually it is smart enough not to make you late if you have something that you CANNOT miss that time.
